## Why am I writing this?
This is my first recap article. I am writing this because I began to set a yearly goal at the beginning of 2022.
Now, as the new year(2023) is approaching, I have the opportunity to cross-match my goals and see the changes.
Besides, I think it's a good way to keep track of my progress year by year. I don't know if anyone else
will have something to take something out from here but it at least will be a reminder to me. Finally, though I am yet
someone to be followed for anything, I follow community influencers like [Freek Van der Herten](https://freek.dev/2400-a-recap-of-2022). So, why
don't I write my not-so-interesting recap?

## Work Environment Setup
Lot of things changed due to COVID-19. It has remarkable impact on the work environment of IT industry. As we work
mostly with a machine(Computer) that can be portable(Laptop), a new revolution started which called "Working from home". 
Though by now the effect of COVID-19 is not as strong as before, it has left its mark. From my side, I bought an 
electric height adjustable table, an 32-inch monitor at the end of this year so that I can work from 
home comfortably. I also replaced my 2015 Intel Macbook Pro by a new 2021 M1 Macbook Pro. I regularly use pen and 
paper to list down all my tasks of the day at the beginning of the day on my notebook. For all my long term
tasks/wishlist, I use Google's Tasks app. I still try to keep my setup as minimal as possible, but staying minimal
is getting complicated day by day.

## My YouTube Channel
I started my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ImranicShow) in 2021. I started with a 
[PHP tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gNAiJi2qzM&list=PLbBHxjfPgatjkgBCfi98sIxi_UYH7EHr-)
in my mother tongue(Bangla) for the beginners who want to start learning web development with PHP. After completing that series, I started another series to explain 
[SOLID principles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpErMHYLkqA&list=PLbBHxjfPgathatwksq5RiGqcgou6VIv4g)
in PHP with practical examples. I haven't finished with this SOLID principles series yet. I had a goal to create at least 50 videos for my
channel in 2022, but I created only 30 videos. I haven't achieved my target but still I am happy with the numbers.
Form now on I just want it to continue, my target for this year will be same as before. One remarkable change in my YouTube channel might happen this
year is, I will start creating video in English. Though my english is not in a level to start speaking publicly, I want to be shameless in public 
speaking.

## Books
I only read 7 books in 2022, I wanted to read at least 12 books. I count all the (small, silly) books I read. I don't know why,
I don't enjoy reading fiction books anymore. I choose to watch Movies or TV-Series for fiction nowadays.
Here is the list of books I read in 2022 and my one-line feedback.

1. **1. Show your work(by Austin Kleon):** This is a small very effective even somewhat life-changing book. Highly recommended.
2. **2. Laravel Beyond CRUD(by Brent Roose):** Awesome book that explains a possible organization of big Laravel Projects. Highly recommended.
3. **3. Atomic Habits(by James Clear):** Quite a popular book for discussing the impact of habits in our life and how to form good habits. Highly recommended.
4. **4. I will Teach You to Be Rich(by Ramit Sethi):** This book contains useful for building wealth, especially in UAS's contexts. Learned a few things but didn't enjoy the book much.
5. **5. যুক্তিফাঁদে ফড়িং(by Chomok Hasan):** An awesome book written in Bangla for beginners who want to know about logical fallacy. Recommended for Bangla readers.
6. **6. Ten++ Ways to Make Money as a Developer(by Florin Pop):** Ideally I avoid books with this sort of catchy(click-bite) title, but as I was following Florin Pop on Twitter, I am influenced. The book is not bad, recommended.
7. **7. It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work(by Json Fried):** An impactful book about the importance of personal life and work-life balance. Highly Recommended especially to the people who run businesses/companies.

I started reading 2 more books related to databases and Machine Learning but haven't finished yet.

## Articles
This is the most embarrassing area for me to talk about. I wrote just one non-technical article this whole year! I wanted to write way more than this.
I think I write less because I feel my writing will be mostly useless. I am motivated to write more even if those are useless.
Let's see how far I can go.
<br><br>

## Overall
I am not unhappy with my progress this year, but I can see there is a lot of room to improve. I am looking forward to writing more
articles and read more books.
