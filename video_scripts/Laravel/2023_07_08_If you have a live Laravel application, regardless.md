If you have a live Laravel application, regardless of its size, it's crucial to back up your valuable user's data. While your codebase may already be backed up on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, the most critical element to back up is the user data like Database or File Storage. If you're using AWS cloud services, backing up the database is a straightforward process. However, if you're hosting your project elsewhere or you don't want to incur additional costs by using services like S3 or RDS, there's a free and easy alternative: that is Google Drive.

If you have a Gmail account, you likely already have access to Google Drive, which provides 15GB of free storage. For most small projects, this amount is more than sufficient. In this video, I'll guide you step by step on how to back up your Laravel application database to Google Drive.
