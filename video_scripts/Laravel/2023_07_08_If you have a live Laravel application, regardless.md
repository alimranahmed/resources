If you have a live Laravel application, regardless of its size, it's crucial to back up your valuable user data. While your codebase may already be backed up on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, the most critical element to back up is the database. If you're using AWS cloud services, backing up the database is a straightforward process. However, if you're hosting your project elsewhere and don't want to incur additional costs by using services like S3 or RDS, there's a free and easy alternative: Google Drive.

If you have a Gmail account, you likely already have access to Google Drive, which provides 5GB of free storage. For most small projects, this amount is more than sufficient. In this video, I'll guide you step by step on how to back up your database to Google Drive using Laravel packages.

This tutorial is divided into three steps:
Step 1: How to back up your Laravel application database.
Step 2: How to integrate Google Drive as a storage service in Laravel.
Step 3: How to back up your application database to Google Drive.

Without further ado, let's dive into Step 1: How to back up your Laravel application database.
