Alright, today we are going to talk about Laravel Herd. 

Laravel Herd is an application that provides development environment for Laravel, only in MacOS right now. This application is developed by BeyondCode who also developed awesome products like TinkerWell, Helo and DBngine. 

Laravel Herd was announced in last LaraCon US and I haven't tried it yet. So, I will tinker with it for the first time while recording this video. 

Before jumping into Laravel Herd let me tell you what I used right now for my local development. 

Currently, I use Laravel Valet which is a Laravel's first party CLI application for Laravel development in MacOS. I am quite happy with Valet. To me it's already one of the fastest local development environment for Laravel. It's not a dockrazied environment, so all the things you need, I mean the dependencies are installed in your own local machine. You need to install those dependencies by yourself. Besides, as Valet is a CLI aplication, it doesn't have any graphical interface out of the box. But you can switch PHP versions, can do some other things like starting, stopping, restarting, parking path, liking project etc. via the Valet CLI. 

Interestingly, there is another application called PHP Monitor which has a graphical user interface using which you can manage valet. So, in summary my current development environment is a combination of Laravel valet and PHP Monitor, and it works great. I am happy with this experience already. Let me show you:

Now we have a new application called Laravel Herd that promise for faster and more hassel free experience. Let's try. 

I already have valet in my machine, and Herd is saying it can make the transition for all my existing projects in Valet. So nothing to worry about. Let's follow the documentation for the installation process.
